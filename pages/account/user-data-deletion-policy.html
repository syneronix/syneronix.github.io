            <h1 class="main-title">CryptoBook User Data Deletion Policy</h1>
            <p style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; color: #aaa;">Last Updated: 19.11.2025</p>
            <p>Welcome to CryptoBook! This document provides clear instructions on how users can fully delete their data
                associated with the CryptoBook App.</p>
            <p>The CryptoBook App is designed for data privacy. We <strong>do not store any user-synced data on our own
                    servers</strong>. All synchronized user data (files) are stored exclusively within your personal
                Google Drive account. The App only accesses your Google Drive and your email address for synchronization
                purposes.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Complete Data Deletion Instructions</h2>
            <p>To completely delete your data associated with the CryptoBook App and ensure all data is removed from
                your device and Google Drive, you must follow these three steps in order:</p>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Step 1: Uninstall the App and Clear Local Data</h3>
            <p>This step ensures that all local data, cache, and settings stored on your device are permanently removed.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>On your device, find the <strong>CryptoBook</strong> App.</li>
                <li>Clear the App's local cache and storage (This is usually done in the device's main <strong>Settings
                        > Apps > CryptoBook > Storage</strong> menu).</li>
                <li><strong>Uninstall</strong> the <strong>CryptoBook</strong> App from your device.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Step 2: Revoke App Access from Your Google Account</h3>
            <p>Revoking access prevents the App from accessing your Google Drive and email address in the future.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to your Google Account Security Settings for connected applications: <strong>Third-party apps
                        with account access</strong> (<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank"
                        class="force-yellow-link">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>).</li>
                <li>Find and click on <strong>CryptoBook</strong> in the list of applications.</li>
                <li>Click the <strong>"Remove Access"</strong> button.</li>
                <li>Confirm the action in the pop-up window.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Step 3: Delete Synced Files from Google Drive</h3>
            <p>If you have synchronized data using the App, it is stored as files or folders on your Google Drive. You
                must delete these files manually:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to Google Drive: <a href="https://drive.google.com" class="force-yellow-link"
                        target="_blank">https://drive.google.com</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Locate the files/folder</strong> associated with <strong>CryptoBook</strong>. (Look for a
                    folder or files explicitly created by the App).</li>
                <li><strong>Select</strong> all files and folders you wish to delete.</li>
                <li>Right-click and choose <strong>"Remove"</strong> (Move to Trash).</li>
                <li>For permanent deletion, navigate to the <strong>"Trash"</strong> section, select the files, and
                    choose <strong>"Delete forever"</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Note:</strong> If the App uses Google's hidden application data space
                (App Data Folder), this data is automatically and permanently deleted when you remove the App's access
                in Step 2.</p>
            <hr>
